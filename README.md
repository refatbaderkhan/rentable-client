### User Stories
-As a Borrower, I want to go on rentable, so I can sit at home comfortably and search for items I can borrow temporarily without the need to buy them.
-As a Lender, I want to list my items for rent on Rentable, so I will make money out of them.
-As a Borrower, after finding a listing Iâ€™m interested in, I want to know more about it, so I will text the Lender through the built-in direct messages feature.
-As a Borrower, I donâ€™t want to take risks, so I will check the Lenderâ€™s rating.
-As a Lender, I donâ€™t want to take risks, so I will check the Borrowersâ€™s rating.

<!-- Prototyping -->

> I designed Rentable using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

### Wireframes

###  Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
